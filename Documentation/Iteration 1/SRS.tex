\section{Document Purpose}

The purpose of this document is to define requirements for the web application \index{354TheStars}354TheStars. This document may thus be used to orient the development of the application. It seeks to understand the requirements of the problem, formulate the necessary functions and properties needed to answer this problem and its requirements, and then test these functions against the requirements. Hence, it may be used by our users to specify the problem and its requirements, by the developers to understand what functions their system must implement, and what to test their system against. The primary audience for this document are the stakeholders of the project and the development team of the system, as well as the project testers for fine-tuning their testing strategy.

\section{Project description}

\subsection{System Context}

Our system will mainly involve the user interacting with a web application interface. The user shall create an account to be able to buy or sell \index{product}products, however user does not require to have an account for browsing the website. The user \index{information}information will be stored in a remote database server. Users will not be able to create an account or login by using any social media platforms. It will be discussed in more details in future versions of this documentation.


\subsection{Project Scope}
\index{354TheStars}354TheStars is planning to provide a worldwide platform, where various sized companies as well as individuals can sell or buy \index{product}products. All of the available products shall be eligible for sale.

\subsection{Business Goals}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Compete with existing solutions}

        We are not the sole developers of e-commerce applications by far. As such, if we want to attract users to our platform, we must be able to compete on the same playing field as these current platforms. It is because of that reason, we must, at the very least, provide a secure, easy to use, and performant platform.

    \item \textbf{Reduce service fee}
        We are aiming to empower businesses, and in order to do so, it is necessary to provide a great service and a competitive service fee.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Personas} \label{actors}
\subsubsection{Admin}
The website \index{administrator}administrator maintains the site and has access to manage all the
\index{product}products and users on \index{354TheStars}354TheStars. As a representative of the site, their duties include
work with the programming that operates the platform, as well as making sure
everything is running smoothly and according to the rules and code of conduct.
This is the only role not operated or embodied by customers.
\subsubsection{Buyer}
\index{buyer}Buyers represent one role of \index{354TheStars}354TheStars' \index{registered user}registered users. Whether they are
an individual or a business, they can search, filter and purchase items from \index{seller}sellers,
which will be delivered to their preferred address. Moreover, they can also \index{review}review
the \index{product}products they have acquired from the site and even provide pictures to depict
their feelings and the state of the \index{product}product received. Finally, buyers will be providing
354TheStars with revenue through a commision acquired from each purchase.
\subsubsection{Guest User}
\index{guest user}Guest users are individuals or businesses that are casually visiting \index{354TheStars}354TheStars,
or future \index{buyer}buyers or \index{seller}sellers that have not yet registered themselves on the site.
They have the same privileges as \index{registered user}registered users (buyers and sellers) but making
purchases or sales; therefore, for a guest user to complete an order or
to start listing \index{product}products, they must create an account.
\subsubsection{Seller}
\index{seller}Sellers represent the other possible role of our \index{registered user}registered users. Whether they are
an individual or a business, they can list products and provide a description,
images, price and modify their available stock for sale. Lastly, \index{seller}sellers can also
reply to \index{review}reviews from \index{buyer}buyers to better address their customers.
\subsubsection{PayPal}
\index{PayPal}PayPal is the only actor that is not embodied by a human. PayPal Holdings Inc. is
an American company that operates a worldwide online \index{payment}payment platform. \index{354TheStars}354TheStars
will be using \index{PayPal}PayPal's services to process money transactions needed for the purchase
and sale of items on the site. They have no say in the activities or the
decision-making process to mantain and manage \index{354TheStars}354TheStars, meaning the only
relationship with the site will be of processing payments. Finally, this takes
place by redirecting \index{buyer}buyers to PayPal's website for them to input their \index{payment}payment
and billing \index{information}information to be processed.



\subsection{Functional Requirements} \label{func req}

This section will cover the functional requirements associated with the \index{354TheStars}354TheStars web application. These are the software capabilities that must be present in order for the user to carry out the services provided by the app or to execute the use cases.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sell:} The system allows a registered user to add \index{product}product and its details (price, description, image) to be able to sell the product.
    \item \textbf{Buy:} The system allows a \index{registered user}registered user to buy a product. Also the \index{buyer}buyer can \index{review}review the purchased product after fifteen days.
    \item  \textbf{Search:} The system allows both a registered user and \index{guest user}guest user to browse and search through all the \index{product}products.
    \item  \textbf{Admin panel:} The \index{administrator}admin panel allows the admin to manage, view, and edit user accounts and their \index{information}information such as (username, email, address, phone number). The panel also allows the admin to manage, view and edit all the products in the website.
    \item \textbf{Purchase process:} The system provides a secure and safe online \index{payment}payment system for \index{buyer}buyers. They can use their \index{PayPal}PayPal account to buy \index{product}products from the website.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}\label{nonfunc req}

\begin{requirement}{Interface}
    \addrow{Requirement ID:}{01}
    \addrow{Type:}{Quality of Service}
    \addrow{Description:}{The website should be intuitive, easy to navigate and provide the \index{administrator}administrator with a quality experience when accessing and viewing the account \index{information}information of a user.}
    \addrow{Reasoning:}{If the website is not user-friendly and intuitive to use, the user will feel overwhelmed and have the desire to exit. It should be easy for the \index{administrator}administrator to navigate the website, otherwise it would be a challenge to keep the organization up.}
    \addrow{Quality attribute scenario:}{Users should be able to familiarize themselves with the website within seconds of visiting it.}
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}{Security}
    \addrow{Requirement ID:}{02}
    \addrow{Type:}{Quality of Service}
    \addrow{Description:}{The application should provide the user with the utmost security. All transactions should be made if and only if valid credentials were provided, if not the service should be denied.}
    \addrow{Reasoning:}{A user should be able to navigate through the application without being concerned about an intruder obtaining access to the user's personal \index{information}information. The trust built through the level of security provided to the users is what will lead to the success of the application. The user is trusting our service by providing sensitive information such as personal email address, \index{payment}payment information etc. and mishandling this \index{data}data would greatly damage the business's reputation.  }
    \addrow{Quality attribute scenario:}{All sensitive information should be hidden. The database storing all the personal information needs to be encrypted.}
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}{Performance}
    \addrow{Requirement ID:}{03}
    \addrow{Type:}{Quality of Service}
    \addrow{Description:}{The website should run in a smooth fashion. Searching for an item should be quick and efficient.}
    \addrow{Reasoning:}{If the user experiences any problem with searching or posting an item they will not be satisfied.}
    \addrow{Quality attribute scenario:}{No matter how full the database gets the performance should always remain optimal. This will provide a quality experience for the user.}
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}{Reliability}
    \addrow{Requirement ID:}{04}
    \addrow{Type:}{Quality of Service}
    \addrow{Description:}{The service should be reliable and functional to the users at all time. If updates need to be made, users will be informed and given enough time to finish any transactions that need to be completed. }
    \addrow{Reasoning:}{Reliability is what will provide users access to the application at all time. If the application is riddled with issues and bugs, users will consider moving to one of the competitors. The business will not and cannot be successful if the users are not provided a fully functional service at all time. }
    \addrow{Quality attribute scenario:}{The system will be online at all times providing services all around the clock. Back up of the system \index{data}data will provide a continuous run time of the application even if parts of the application were to fail.}
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}{Maintainability}
    \addrow{Requirement ID:}{05}
    \addrow{Type:}{Development Constraint}
    \addrow{Description:}{The application should be able to adapt to newer features and innovations that may occur. To maintain the current application, the testing should be divided into multiple instances, before releasing it to production.}
    \addrow{Reasoning:}{Due to the growth in technology, the application should be able to adapt to future changes. The application should also be easy to maintain and make changes to. If a complete tear up is required to apply updates, it becomes an issue. To make it cost effective and future proof, maintainability needs to be easily applied.}
    \addrow{Quality attribute scenario:}{Any changes to the application need to go through the developer server and test server before making out to production. In this manner, we make multiple verifications and avoid downtime due to new updates.}
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}{Distribution}
    \addrow{Requirement ID:}{06}
    \addrow{Type:}{Architectural Constraint}
    \addrow{Description:}{The website should work well in both desktop and mobile browsers.}
    \addrow{Reasoning:}{Mobile phones are extremely common. The user should not have a problem navigating it through their phone.}
    \addrow{Quality attribute scenario:}{We are taking advantage of the portability of mobile phones, making sure users can experience the website wherever they have their mobile devices.}
