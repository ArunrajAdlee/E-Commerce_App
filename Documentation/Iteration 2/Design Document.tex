        First, the website retrieves the clientâ€™s ID through cookies which is then used to query the Clients table in the database. With this, the clientâ€™s information is retrieved from the database and displayed to the client through an editable form. Next, the client edits the information in this form and submits it. If this form contains invalid data, the website redisplays the form, indicating the invalid data. The client then corrects the form and resubmits it, which is then validated once again and so, until the data in the form is valid. Finally, the website edits the corresponding client entity in the Client table of the database and the database returns the edited client. This ends with a confirmation displayed to the client indicating that the edit was successful.
