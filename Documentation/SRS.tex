\section{Document Purpose}

The purpose of this document is to define requirements for the web application 354TheStars. This document may thus be used to orient the development of the application. It seeks to understand the requirements of the problem, formulate the necessary functions and properties needed to answer this problem and its requirements, and then test these functions against the requirements. Hence, it may be used by our users to specify the problem and its requirements, by the developers to understand what functions their system must implement, and what to test their system against. The primary audience for this document are the stakeholders of the project and the development team of the system, as well the project testers for fine-tuning their testing strategy.

\section{Project description}

\subsection{System Context}

Our system will mainly involve the user interacting with a web application interface. The user shall create an account to be able to buy or sell products, however user does not require to have an account for browsing the website. The user information will be stored in a remote database server. Users will not be able to create an account or login by using any social media platforms. It will discussed in more details in future version of this documentation.

\clearpage

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    % \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{context.png}
    \caption{System Context}
    \label{fig:system-context}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Project Scope}
354TheStars is planning to provide a worldwide platform, where various size of companies as well as individuals can sell or buy products. All of the available products shall be eligible for sale.

\subsection{Business Goals}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Compete with existing solutions}

        We are not the sole developers of e-commerce applications by far. As such, if we want to attract users to our platform, we must be able to compete on the same playing field as these current platforms. It is because of that reason, we must, at the very least, provide a secure, easy to use, and performant platform.

    \item \textbf{Reduce service fee}
        We are aiming to empower businesses, and in order to do so, it is necessary to provide a great service and a competitive service fee.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Personas} \label{actors}
\subsubsection{Admin}
The website administrator maintains the site and has access to manage all the
products and users on 354TheStars. As a representative of the site, their duties include
work with the programming that operates the platform, as well as making sure
everything is running smoothly and according to the rules and code of conduct.
This is the only role not operated or embodied by customers.
\subsubsection{Buyer}
Buyers represent one role of 354TheStars' registered users. Whether they are
an individual or a business, they can search, filter and purchase items from sellers,
which will be delivered to their preferred address. Moreover, they can also review
the products they have acquired from the site and even provide pictures to depict
their feelings and the state of the product received. Finally, buyers will be providing
354TheStars with revenue through a commision acquired from each purchase.
\subsubsection{Guest User}
Guest users are individuals or businesses that are casually visiting 354TheStars,
or future buyers or sellers that have not yet registered themselves on the site.
They have the same privileges as registered users (buyers and sellers) but making
purchases or sales; therefore, for a guest user to complete an order or
to start listing products, they must create an account.
\subsubsection{Seller}
Sellers represent the other possible role of our registered users. Whether they are
an individual or a business, they can list products and provide a description,
images, price and modify their available stock for sale. Lastly, sellers can also
reply to reviews from buyers to better address their customers.
\subsubsection{PayPal}
PayPal is the only actor that is not embodied by a human. PayPal Holdings Inc. is
an American company that operates a worldwide online payment platform. 354TheStars
will be using PayPal's services to process money transactions needed for the purchase
and sale of items on the site. They have no say in the activities or the
decision-making process to mantain and manage 354TheStars, meaning the only
relationship with the site will be of processing payments. Finally, this takes
place by redirecting buyers to PayPal's website for them to input their payment
and billing information to be processed.



\subsection{Functional Requirements} \label{func req}

This section will cover the functional requirements associated with the 354TheStars web application. These are the software capabilities that must be present in order for the user to carry out the services provided by the app or to execute the use cases.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sell:} The system allows a registered user to add product and its details (price, description, image) to be able to sell the product.
    \item \textbf{Buy:} The system allows a registered user to buy a product. Also the buyer can review the purchased product after fifteen days.
    \item  \textbf{Search:} The system allows both a registered user and guest user to browse and search through all the products.
    \item  \textbf{Admin panel:} The admin panel allows the admin to manage, view, and edit user accounts and their information such as (username, email, address, phone number). The panel also allows the admin to manage, view and edit all the products in the website.
    \item \textbf{Purchase process:} The system provides a secure and safe online payment system for buyers. They can use their Paypal account to buy products from the website.
\end{itemize}

\section{Use Cases}
\subsection{Overview}
Use cases 1 through 4 deal with the user manipulating his user  and bank accounts. Use cases 5 through 8 deal with the user viewing the data in different formats. Use case 9 deals with the user manipulating the transactions categories.

\textbf{NB:} Note that the alternate flows are described in the same order as the exception. That is, for example, alternate flow 2 specifies the flow of the application if exception 2 is met.
